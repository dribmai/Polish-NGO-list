# Polish-NGOs-list
The aim of the project is to collect information from Polish portal of non-governmental organizations about non-governmental organizations in selected category. 
The information will come from the website https://spis.ngo.pl/. 
To extract most information I used libraries requests and BeautifulSoup, and to decrypt email addresses I used selenium.

Setting up the environment - Project works only with Firefox at the moment. 
I used selenium.webdriver for Firefox
